# Ticket App
This is my very first attempt at creating a website using react with no previous knowledge of javascript and reactjs.

# Website link
Click this link to check out the website https://dr-fisk.github.io/ticket

# How to use 
The dashboard will show the requests that have been submitted. As of now there is no system to handle organization of these requests.
This will come in a future update.<br />
You can submit a ticket by simply clicking the add ticket link. Make sure to fill out the form and click submit. The date is automatically
selected as the current date.<br />
There is a calendar widget which you can scroll by clicking the left and right arrows to switch months. The calendar shows the current day
and the days in a month. If you click on a day that is from a previous month or from the next month, then the month will switch. For example
If I click on December 31, 2020, when the calendar shows January 2021, the calendar will switch to December 2020.

# About
This website is eventually going to develop into a type of ticket request app. People or a group can submit tickets
which states an issue with a project or perhaps the website, feature request, etc. Please note this is still in development
and currently I update the app around once a day.

# Future plans
I plan on adding organization to the dashboard. I don't want there to be an infinite amount of requests which would cause a user to have
to continuously scroll. Instead I plan on adding pages which you can click on (ex: 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) This will then display x amount of requests
per page.<br />
Another feature I want to add is when I click on the day on the calendar in dashboard, I want it to showcase either the requests that were submitted
on that day, or requests due on that day perhaps.<br />
There also is a check planned for the add ticket page, as of now you can submit an empty request which is not desirable.<br />
Also I plan to update the about page with probably how to use the app, my info, and maybe projects I've worked on?<br />
This is what is planned so far.
